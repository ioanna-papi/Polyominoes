# How to run the code:
    python count_fixed_polyominoes.py [-p] <n>

In this command, the <n> parameter is the size of the polynomials. If the user gives the -p parameter before them, the graph we construct will be printed on the screen.

The output of the program will be the graph we construct to solve the problem and the number of free polynomials.
